                    <h2>IED: Irish Emigration Database</h2>
                    <p>The IED is a virtual library of emigration-related primary sources, principally letters to and from emigrants, compiled by the Centre for Migration Studies, Omagh. This extensive collection of more than 33,000 records is drawn from a number of collections, including the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland and many private donors, and is capable of expansion as new records become available. It covers a wide time period, but with a concentration on the period between c.1780 and c.1920.</p>

The study participants represent a range of geographic origins within Ulster, class backgrounds and religious denominations.</p>
